;; we need to be a whole lot clearer about whether we're playing,
;; what we're playing (now/next), and why we're not playing

;; so we have desired state ("we are pointing at queue entry 3 and
;; 'play' has been activated")
;; and actual state ("we have played 34s of the track with url ...; we
;; ran out of data and now the player is paused")

;; also: whether we *want* to be in 'play' or 'pause' has no bearing
;; on whether there is anything playable in the queue

;; when the player is playing it is sending us messages about the
;; current play time.  when we use the 'skip track' button we also
;; have to tell the player to change track. so there's information
;; flowing both ways there
