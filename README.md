# Sledge - We're lost in music

Available protocols such as DAAP, DLNA etc for publishing music media
files (e.g. ripped CDs) on the local network and/or the internet are
either insanely complex or proprietary or sometimes both.  Which is odd given that HTTP is so eminently suited to schlepping bits across the net.

Sledge is a spare-time/weekend hack to see if there's a simpler way.
It uses [green-tags](https://github.com/DanPallas/green-tags) and [clucy](https://github.com/weavejester/clucy) to index your audio /linkmedia collection, embeds a web server that knows how to transcode it (requires [libav](https://libav.org/)) then provides a single-page JS (actually ClojureScript) app that lets you search it and play the music.

Status: definitely early days, but works on my machine.  More or less.

## Building

Requires Leinigen. Clone the git repo, then

    $ lein do deps, uberjar

## Usage

    $ java -jar sledge-0.1.0-standalone.jar 

And point your web browser at http://localhost:53281

Why the restriction?  It depends on libav for transcoding, and libav is GPL, and Affero GPL seems to be a good option for enforcing the spirit of GPL for systems where the software itself lives on a server and is not actually distibuted to its users. 

If that poses a problem for your preferred use case, I am happy to
discuss alternative licencing arrangements.
