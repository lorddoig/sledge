# Sledge - We're lost in music

Available protocols such as DAAP, DLNA etc for publishing music media
files (e.g. ripped CDs) on the local network and/or the internet are
either insanely complex or proprietary or sometimes both.  Which is odd given that HTTP is so eminently suited to schlepping bits across the net.

Sledge is a spare-time/weekend hack to see if there's a simpler way.
It runs [green-tags](https://github.com/DanPallas/green-tags) on your audio collection and creates an index on disk, then starts a web server that knows how to transcode it (requires [libav](https://libav.org/)) and provides a single-page JS (actually ClojureScript) app that lets you search it and play the music.

Status: works on my machine, works on my phone (Firefox for Android), ugly, many rough edges.

## Configuring

First create a configuration file to tell it where your music collection is and where to create its index files

```
$ cat sledge.conf.edn
{:index "/srv/media/.sledge/"
 :folders ["/srv/media/Music/"]
 :port 53281
}
```

## Running in development mode

I have not as yet manage to figure out why the leiningen `dev` profile appears to be loaded even when making uberjars.  Until I do (and all advice on that score is welcome), it is necessary to use an additional profile to include dev-only configuration such as the browser repl

    $ lein with-profile +brepl cljsbuild auto
    # and in another window
    $ lein with-profile +brepl repl
    sledge.core=> (-main "conf.edn")

Now point your web browser at http://localhost:53281

A websocket-based browser repl is available, assuming your browser
supports websockets: run `(user/simple-brepl)` to start it.


## Running in deployment mode

    $ lein with-profile uberjar do clean, cljsbuild once, uberjar
    $ java -jar target/uberjar+uberjar/sledge-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar sledge.conf.edn

Now point your web browser at http://localhost:53281

Why the restriction?  It depends on libav for transcoding, and libav is GPL, and Affero GPL seems to be a good option for enforcing the spirit of GPL for systems where the software itself lives on a server and is not actually distibuted to its users. 

If that poses a problem for your preferred use case, I am happy to
